# fastai-shell

A workflow to setup and use [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) on Google Cloud Platfrom

[![How to use fastai-shell](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50838/48072112-d3240d00-e201-11e8-860d-22bc5a9697ee.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui_y60ZtE5c)

Here is a set of features `fastai-shell` gives you:

* Use [preemptible](https://cloud.google.com/compute/pricing#gpus) instances to get the minimum price possible
* Switch between different GPUs based on your requirement and cost
* Keep data and tools you installed even when switching between GPUs
* No need to install anything locally, you just need a web browser
* Fully automated process, no SSH or complex commands required
* Switch your instance between different availability zones

## Installation

Create an [account](https://cloud.google.com) on Google Cloud Platform.<br/>
<sup>You will get $300 credits for a new signup.</sup>

Go to your project and open the Google Cloud shell as shown below:

![Google Cloud Shell](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50838/47280304-53882280-d5f3-11e8-92d0-c0625b728967.png)

Then run the following commands:

```
curl -L https://git.io/fpwgT | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Getting Started

You can create a fastai instance with:

```
fastai create
```

Then you can start that instance by running:

```
fastai start
```

That will show you a list of GPU options available. You can select one based on your requirements and cost.

After you have finished with your instance, run:

```
fastai stop
```

This will delete the instance and stop paying for the GPU.<br/>
But it will keep the all of the data you saved and any additional tool you installed.

The next time, you can simply type `fastai start` and continue working with your project.

## Cost

Here we use preemptible instances, so the cost will be [very low](https://cloud.google.com/compute/pricing#gpus).<br/>
After you type `fastai start`, you can select an instance and see the estimated hourly cost.<br/>
(It's a range between $0.02/hour to $0.83/hour.)

After you stop your instance with `fastai stop`, you won't get charged for the computing power and GPU.

But here we use a 50GB SSD boot disk which won't get deleted with the `fastai stop` command.<br/>
It will cost around $8.50/month.

> You can run `fastai destroy` to delete that disk.<br/>
> But then, you need to run `fastai create` everytime when you need to work with your notebooks. <br/>
> (This will destroy everything you saved and it will take around 5-20 minutes to complete the `fastai create` process)

## Test Availability of a Zone

Sometimes the current availability zone has no resources to start an instance. In that case, we should try another zone.<br/>
Here's a simple utilty to test that.

First of all invoke the folling command:

```
fastai list-zones
```

Then select a zone and a gpu.

After that invoke this command:

```
fastai test-zone <zone> <gpu>
```

If this commands throws an error, try a different zone/gpu combination.

## Switching Zones

With the demand for computing power in the current availability zone, sometimes Google won't let you create instances. Usually this will last for a couple of hours and could happen at anytime.

Luckily with `fastai-shell`, you can switch your instance to a different zone and continue working with your models.

To do that, select an availability zone by typing:

```
fastai list-zones
```

Now, you will see a list of GPUs available in each zone.

Then select a zone and run:

```
fastai switch-to <selected-zone>
```

This will move your boot disk to the selected zone and it will take between 5 - 20 minutes to complete.

After that, you can simply type `fastai start` and continue working with your models.

## Stay up to date

This is a project that is constantly updating with your feedback.<br/>
(But we won't do breaking changes at this point.)

At anytime, you can run the following command to get the latest version:

```
curl -L https://git.io/fpeMb | bash
```

You can check the installed version by typing: `fastai version`

## Help

Simply type `fastai help` or create [an issue](https://github.com/toalmj/fastai-shell).
